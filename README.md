### Simple FLASK based API for exposing system details

Currently used by myself for HA integration and monitoring of remote servers

It supports all operating systems. 

Suspend function is a work in progress and is currently used for remotely suspending a windows machine using something like Home Assistant or Alexa

## Usage

1. Rename monitor.example to monitor.conf
2. Populate the config file with the relevant sections (More instructions coming soon)
3. Start the python script (Currently runs on 5001 by default, it is recommend you change this)
